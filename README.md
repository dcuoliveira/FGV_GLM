# FGV_GLM
This repository will be used to organize all the codes written on the statistical modelling course given at the school of applied math at FGV-Rio on 2020 by prof. Claudio Struchiner. The main goal of the course is to teach students about **generalized linear models (GLM)** with a **bayesian perspective**. 

The syllabus of the course and official github page can be found [here](https://github.com/claustru/ME-pos/blob/master/Docs/EmentaModelagemEstatisticaMestradoClaudioStruchiner.pdf).
